This project tries to mimic the behaviour of [Etch-A-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) on the Browser viewport using Flexbox to create the plotting surface and JavaScript to actually plot the points using mouse movements.

This goal of this project is to teach myself the basics of DOM Manipulation using Javascript and Flexbox.

TODO: 
- [ ] Make the main page take input and scroll down to the etch-a-sketch page for sketching
- [ ] Change input to intuitive range where increasing size means sliding the range slider to right
- [x] Create a button for clearing the board
